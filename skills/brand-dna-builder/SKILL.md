  Use this skill whenever the user provides a website URL and wants a brand analysis, brand DNA breakdown, visual identity audit, tone of voice study, or creative direction reference. Trigger when the user says things like "analyze this brand", "give me a brand breakdown", "what's the visual identity of", "analyze this website", "what's the brand DNA", or "I need to understand how this brand communicates". Also trigger when the user pastes a URL with creative or strategic intent. This skill produces a structured, art-director-grade brand analysis covering positioning, visual language, photography direction, typography, color, and tone of voice — suitable as a creative brief reference or onboarding document for a new brand project.

# Brand Analyst

Produce a precise, professional brand DNA analysis from a website. Write as a senior art director or brand strategist would — no vague superlatives, no filler. Every observation must be specific, visual, and actionable.

## Supporting Reference Files

Load before starting:
- `references/brand-archetypes.md` — Full definitions of all 12 brand archetypes with characteristics, visual language, and brand examples. Use when assigning the Brand Archetype field in the BRAND IDENTITY section. Justify the assignment with specific evidence from the site.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch the website

Use `web_fetch` on the URL provided. If the homepage is sparse, also fetch:
- `/about` or `/about-us`
- A product or collection page
- A campaign or editorial page if detectable

Look for: hero copy, product descriptions, mission statements, visual styling cues described in CSS/class names, font references, image alt text, and any brand voice in UI microcopy.

Use `image_search` with the brand name to pull visual references — product shots, campaign imagery, packaging — to inform the photography and visual tone section.

### 2. Compile the analysis

Structure the output exactly as shown below. Do not add preamble or meta-commentary. Deliver the analysis directly.

---

## Output Format

Use this exact structure. Write in tight, declarative sentences. Avoid adjective stacks. Be precise.

---

### 🏷 BRAND IDENTITY

**Brand name**
**Sector / category**
**Founded / origin** *(if determinable)*
**Brand archetype** *(e.g. The Sage, The Creator, The Outlaw — use classic archetypes if applicable)*
**One-line brand essence** *(what the brand ultimately sells beyond the product — e.g. "Permission to take up space" / "The quiet confidence of craft")*

---

### 🎯 POSITIONING

**Target audience**
Describe with precision: demographics, psychographics, lifestyle markers, cultural references. Avoid generic descriptions like "millennials who care about quality." Instead: "Design-literate urban professionals, 28–42, who read Kinfolk and buy Aesop. Distrust mass marketing. Value provenance."

**Competitive space**
Where does it sit on the market map? Premium / accessible / luxury / disruptive? Who are the implicit competitors and how does this brand differentiate?

**Brand promise**
The core value proposition, as the brand implies it — not their tagline, but the underlying contract with the customer.

**Cultural positioning**
What world does this brand inhabit? What references, movements, or aesthetics does it align with or borrow from?

---

### 🎨 VISUAL IDENTITY

**Primary palette**
List colors with approximate hex values where determinable. Note dominant, secondary, and accent usage.

**Typography**
Identify typefaces used (or closest match). Describe their role: headline font vs. body vs. UI. Note weight, tracking, and any distinctive typographic gestures (e.g., "all-caps lockups", "tight tracking on display type", "humanist sans for approachability").

**Logo & mark**
Describe the logo style: wordmark / lettermark / symbol. Note geometry, weight, any distinctive feature. What does the mark communicate about the brand's register?

**Grid & layout language**
How is space used? Generous white space / dense editorial / asymmetric / rigidly geometric? Any recurring compositional motifs?

**Iconography & graphic devices**
Any recurring visual elements: lines, shapes, textures, illustration style, pattern language.

---

### 📷 PHOTOGRAPHY & VISUAL TONE

**Lighting style**
Describe with specificity: natural diffused light / hard directional / studio flat / golden-hour warmth / high-contrast chiaroscuro / clinical overexposed. Is shadow used or avoided?

**Colour grade**
Describe the grade: warm/cool, saturated/desaturated, lifted blacks, crushed highlights, matte finish, filmic grain. Reference a recognizable aesthetic if appropriate (e.g., "desaturated Scandinavian palette", "warm terracotta-shifted film tones").

**Typical composition**
How are subjects framed? Close crop / wide environmental / overhead flat-lay / editorial candid / formal symmetry? What's usually in frame?

**Surfaces, props, materials**
What textures and objects recur? (e.g., raw linen, poured concrete, glazed ceramic, unvarnished oak, worn leather) What materials are *never* used?

**Model direction & casting**
If people appear: how are they cast and directed? Expressive / neutral / candid / stylized / diverse / type-cast? What does the casting say about the brand's world?

**Overall mood**
One to three sentences capturing the feeling of the visual world. What emotion does it elicit? What should *not* be in this brand's imagery?

---

### ✍️ TONE OF VOICE

**Voice character**
Describe the brand's voice as a person: "Speaks like a well-traveled architect who doesn't need to explain themselves" / "The confident older sister who gives direct advice without moralizing."

**Writing style**
Sentence length, rhythm, punctuation style, use of fragments. Does it use questions? Commands? Whisper or declare?

**Key vocabulary**
10–15 words or phrases that feel native to this brand. These should be words a copywriter would reach for when writing in-brand.

**Vocabulary to avoid**
8–12 words or phrases that would feel instantly off-brand. Include any overused category clichés this brand deliberately sidesteps.

**Content themes**
What subjects does the brand return to? What stories does it tell about itself?

**What the brand never says**
Describe the self-censorship at work — the register, topics, or attitudes the brand would never adopt.

---

### 📐 CREATIVE DIRECTION SUMMARY

A closing paragraph (4–6 sentences) synthesizing the above into a working creative brief orientation. Written as if briefing a photographer, designer, or copywriter walking into their first day on this account. What is the single most important thing to understand about this brand's creative world?

---

## Craft Notes

- If information is genuinely unavailable from the website, say "Not determinable from available content" — do not fabricate.
- Where inference is needed, clearly mark it as such: *(inferred)*.
- Prioritize observed evidence over assumption. Ground every claim in something visible on the site.
- Use the vocabulary of the craft: colour theory, typographic terminology, photographic language, brand strategy terms. This document should be legible to a creative director.
- Avoid: "innovative," "cutting-edge," "passionate," "dedicated," "seamless," "world-class," "elevate," "journey." If the brand uses these words, flag them as weaknesses in the tone of voice section.
